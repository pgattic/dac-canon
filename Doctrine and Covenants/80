Verily, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Stephen Burnett: Go ye, go ye into the world and preach the gospel to every creature that cometh under the sound of your voice.
And inasmuch as you desire a companion, I will give unto you my servant Eden Smith.
Wherefore, go ye and preach my gospel, whether to the north or to the south, to the east or to the west, it mattereth not, for ye cannot go amiss.
Therefore, declare the things which ye have heard, and verily believe, and know to be true.
Behold, this is the will of him who hath called you, your Redeemer, even Jesus Christ. Amen.
